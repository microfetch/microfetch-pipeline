# Data collection

The data collector is used because the BDI servers have access/bandwidth limitations.

_This script will check for droplets awaiting data collection and download the data.
On completion, it will signal to the [ENA monitor](../ENA_monitor/overview.md) that the droplets can be destroyed._
